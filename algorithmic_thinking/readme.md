# Repo: algorithmic_thinking #

Repository for code related to the problems in "Algorithmic Thinking" by Daniel Zingaro.
Code is organized by chapter and further organized by each individual problem presented
in the book. Each chapter contains a README file describing the problem being solved,
accepted input/output, and its corresponding "judge website" and ID value (e.g. dmoj.ca,
problem xxxxxxxxx).
